# Deep Learning Image Classifier with PyTorch

This project uses a pre-labelled academic dataset of images. The goal is to use deep learning to classify these images into their respective classes. This project uses a Simple Neural Network initially, followed by a Convolutional Neural Network, built using PyTorch.

### Features
- EDA
- Tensors
- Deep learning
- GPU acceleration

### Techniques
- PyTorch
- Object Oriented Programming
- Simple and Convolutional neural networks


## Summary
1. The data was explored, visualised and reshaped.
2. A simple neural network was built, and the loss function and optimizer defined.
3. The SNN was trained, used to predict and measured for accuracy.
4. A convolutional neural network was built and trained.
5. The CNN's predictions were measured for accuracy, showing a good performance increase over the SNN.
